I am a 3rd year PhD student at Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I work with [Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) to research political participation in online communication networks, and how social media interact with + modify social movements. My work so far has primarily focused on youth (broadly construed). I aim to center minoritized groups, and examine the ways the internet might be/is leveraged for radically inclusive ends. 

Outside of research, I'm in a committed relationship with my silver nail polish, and always eager to play a game of set.
