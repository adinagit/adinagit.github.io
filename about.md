I am a 2nd year* PhD student at Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I work with [Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) to study marginalization in online communication networks, and how social media interact with + modify social movements. I aim to center minoritized groups in my research, and to offer careful engagement with the way the Internet is leveraged for radically inclusive ends. 

The ðŸ’…s are ironic.

*I actually prefer the term 'pandemic 1st year'
