I am a 2nd year PhD student at Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I work with [Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) to study online communication and marginalization, and the relationship between social media and social movements.
