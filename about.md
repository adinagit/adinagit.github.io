I am a 5th year PhD student at Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I work with [Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) to study political participation in online communication networks. My research focuses on how young people leverage social media to exert their political will and organize/connect with each other. My work stands to push back against the moral panic around youth and social media, which frames their usage as deviant and unhealthy. Instead, I argue that in the face of significant exclusions, social media enables youth agency and participation in public life.
