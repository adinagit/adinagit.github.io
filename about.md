I am a 2nd year* PhD student at Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I work with [Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) to research marginalization in online communication networks, and how social media interact with + modify social movements. I aim to center minoritized groups, and examine the ways the Internet might be/is leveraged for radically inclusive ends.

*I actually prefer the term 'pandemic 1st year'
