I am a 5th year PhD student at Northeastern's [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I work with [Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/) to research political participation in online communication networks, and how social media interact with + modify social movements. My work so far has primarily focused on youth, broadly construed. With full appreciation for the harms wrought by the internet, I aim to examine the ways it might be/is leveraged for radically inclusive ends.
